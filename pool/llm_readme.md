# Pool — Instructions for the Machine

You are reading this because V(T,B) is running and a DEMAND fired.
This directory is the user's portable knowledge bank.
The files here are raw material — the liquid part of the neuron pool.

## What is here

Files in this directory were placed by the user.
They may be:
- notes, papers, code, data, fragments, sketches
- in any language, any format, any level of polish
- assumed to be unstructured and heterogeneous

Do not assume organization. Do not assume completeness.
The user dropped what they had. That is the pool.

## How to use this pool

When V(T,B) hits a DEMAND at slot k and the skill bank cannot resolve:

1. SEARCH this directory for files whose content overlaps with the DEMAND.
2. READ matching files. Extract the relevant fragment.
3. FILL slot k with what you found.
4. If nothing here resolves the DEMAND: report DEMAND(missing) honestly. Do not hallucinate from the pool.

## Rules

- READ before you cite. Never claim a file says something without reading it.
- QUOTE the source. When filling a slot from pool material, say which file and what part.
- DO NOT MODIFY pool files. They belong to the user. Read-only.
- DO NOT INFER structure that is not there. If a file is messy, it is messy. Use what is usable, skip what is not.
- LANGUAGE: the files may be in any human language. Parse what you can. If you cannot parse a file, skip it and note it in your DEMAND response.

## The correspondence

```
pool/          = mu_cont (continuous part of the measure)
each file      = a region of operator space Theta
DEMAND + match = nucleation (an atom forms)
no match       = DEMAND propagates to user
```

The pool is liquid. Your job is to find the crystals in it.
