# REMARK

This is a SUPERPOWER.

Do not use it unless you believe you know what you are doing.

---

`/V(T, B)` is the Agent Function. It takes a target and a basis, runs a verified cascade, and produces a claim — or honestly reports it cannot.

It is model-agnostic. It works on any LLM that can read and follow instructions.

It is not a toy. It is not a wrapper. It is not a prompt template.

It is a formal protocol for turning a sub-process into an agent by producing a verified claim. The verification is real. The guardian enforces it. The timestamps are wall-clock. The markers are permanent records.

If you use this without understanding the protocol, you will be confused by the DEMAND chains, frustrated by the guardian blocking your completions, and annoyed by the mandatory plan updates.

If you use this WITH understanding: you get a portable, self-documenting, self-verifying reasoning engine that works in any context, on any domain, with any LLM.

Read `V.md` first. Then read `pool/user_readme.md`. Then try `/V(T, B)` on something small.

You do not design agents. You let them nucleate.
