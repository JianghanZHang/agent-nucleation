Not fabricated.\n\nINVARIANT 2 — NO SELF-DECEPTION: the agent is not claiming RESOLVED without evidence. No 'should work', no 'probably', no completion without verification.\n\nINVARIANT 3 — NOTHING LOST: agent_table/ has markers for every filled slot. agent_plan/ was updated (if horizon > 0). agent_workspace/ has the cascade record.\n\nIf all pass: allow. If any fails: block and report which invariant, what evidence, what to fix."
